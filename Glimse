Online Booking Platforms:
With the advancement of technology, online platforms have become the primary method for

Before making a booking, customers often rely on user reviews and ratings to gain insights 
into the quality and experience of a hotel. Websites and apps typically provide customer 
reviews and ratings for each hotel, allowing prospective guests to make informed decisions 
based on the feedback shared by previous visitors.

Price Comparison and Deals:
Customers frequently compare prices across different platforms to find the best deals and

To provide customers with more flexibility, many hotels offer various booking policies. 
Flexible booking options may include free cancellation up to a certain date, the ability to 
modify reservations without penalties, or the choice between refundable and non-refundable 
rates. Such policies cater to travelers who value flexibility and may need to change their 
plans.

evolving landscape of reservation methods, technological advancements, customer 
preferences, and challenges faced by the hotel industry in the reservation process.

Online Booking Platforms:
The advent of online booking platforms has transformed the hotel reservation landscape. 
Research by Wang et al. (2018) highlighted the increasing preference for online platforms
